            <p>
              Social Skills Training (SST) is a structured form of therapy designed to help individuals improve their ability to interact effectively and appropriately with others. It focuses on developing communication, relationship-building, and interpersonal skills that are essential in daily life—whether at work, school, home, or in social settings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Social skills are learned behaviors. Just like any other skill, they can be taught, practiced, and improved with the right guidance and support. SST is especially useful for individuals who find social interaction challenging due to developmental conditions, anxiety, or past experiences.
            </p>
