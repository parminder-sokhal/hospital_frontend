            <p>
              Incontinence is a condition that affects the ability to control the bladder or bowels, leading to unintentional leakage. While often associated with aging, incontinence can occur at any stage of life and can affect both men and women. Common types of incontinence include urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and mixed incontinence.

              At [Your Clinic/Practice Name], we offer specialized therapy designed to help individuals manage and overcome incontinence. Our team works closely with each patient to understand the root causes and develop a personalized treatment plan to enhance their quality of life.

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">Types of Incontinence</h2>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">1. Urinary Incontinence</h3>
            <p>Urinary incontinence involves the loss of bladder control, resulting in unintentional urine leakage. It includes:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li><strong>Stress Incontinence:</strong> Leakage occurs with physical activities like coughing, sneezing, or lifting.</li>
              <li><strong>Urge Incontinence:</strong> A sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by leakage.</li>
              <li><strong>Overflow Incontinence:</strong> Constant dribbling of urine due to incomplete bladder emptying.</li>
              <li><strong>Functional Incontinence:</strong> Caused by mobility or cognitive impairments preventing timely bathroom access.</li>
              <li><strong>Mixed Incontinence:</strong> A combination of stress and urge incontinence symptoms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">2. Fecal Incontinence</h3>
            <p>Fecal incontinence is the inability to control bowel movements, leading to accidental leakage of feces. Causes include:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li><strong>Weakened Pelvic Floor Muscles:</strong> Often due to aging or childbirth.</li>
              <li><strong>Neurological Disorders:</strong> Conditions like stroke or multiple sclerosis can interfere with bowel control.</li>
              <li><strong>Constipation:</strong> Chronic constipation can lead to overflow incontinence.</li>
              <li><strong>Rectal Prolapse or Surgery:</strong> Structural issues or surgical complications can affect bowel control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">What Causes Incontinence?</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li><strong>Weak Pelvic Floor Muscles:</strong> Pelvic floor muscles support bladder and bowel control.</li>
              <li><strong>Pregnancy and Childbirth:</strong> Vaginal delivery can stretch pelvic muscles, contributing to urinary incontinence.</li>
              <li><strong>Aging:</strong> Aging can reduce muscle tone and bladder capacity, leading to incontinence.</li>
              <li><strong>Neurological Disorders:</strong> Conditions like multiple sclerosis and Parkinsonâ€™s disease can impair bladder and bowel control.</li>
              <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Excess weight adds pressure on the bladder, increasing incontinence risk.</li>
              <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Diuretics, sedatives, and antidepressants can contribute to incontinence.</li>
              <li><strong>Chronic Conditions:</strong> Diabetes, constipation, and prostate issues are also linked to incontinence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">4. Medications</h3>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">6. Counseling and Support</h3>
