              Evidence-Based Therapy for Real, Lasting Change
            </h2>
            <p>
              Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a highly effective, evidence-based approach to mental health treatment that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. It empowers individuals to recognize and change unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors that cause distress or dysfunction.
            </p>

            <p>
              CBT is grounded in the principle that our thoughts significantly influence how we feel and act. By shifting distorted or negative thinking into more realistic, balanced thoughts, individuals can improve emotional well-being and cultivate healthier behaviors.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">How CBT Works</h2>
            <p>
              CBT is structured, time-limited, and goal-oriented. Rather than dwelling on the past, it focuses on current issues while incorporating past experiences only when necessary. During therapy, you'll work collaboratively with a therapist to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>Identify negative or automatic thoughts</li>
              <li>Understand the link between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors</li>
              <li>Challenge and reframe unhelpful thinking patterns</li>
              <li>Develop healthier coping strategies and responses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Homework such as journaling, tracking thoughts, or practicing new behaviors reinforces what is learned in sessions.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">What CBT Can Help With</h2>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">Benefits of CBT</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>Structured and time-efficient (often 6–20 sessions)</li>

            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">What to Expect in a CBT Session</h2>
            <p>
              The first session focuses on understanding your concerns and goals. Sessions typically include collaborative discussions, problem-solving, and skill-building exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may receive exercises, thought logs, or worksheets to complete between sessions to enhance your progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              CBT is an active, empowering process — your therapist guides, but you play the lead role in creating change.
