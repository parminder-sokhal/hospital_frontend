              Balancing Acceptance and Change for a Healthier Life
            </h2>
            <p>
              Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a structured, evidence-based form of cognitive-behavioral therapy developed to help individuals manage intense emotions, reduce harmful behaviors, and improve interpersonal relationships. Originally designed for borderline personality disorder (BPD), it now benefits a wide range of emotional and behavioral challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              The word “dialectical” reflects DBT’s balance between two opposites—acceptance and change. Clients are encouraged to accept themselves as they are while also working to change behaviors that no longer serve them.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">What Makes DBT Unique?</h2>
            <p>
              DBT merges traditional CBT techniques with mindfulness, acceptance, and emotional regulation strategies. It is highly structured and often includes multiple formats of therapy delivery:
