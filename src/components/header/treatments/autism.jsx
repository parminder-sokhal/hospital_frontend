            <p>
              Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects how individuals perceive and interact with the world around them. The spectrum of autism is broad, meaning that symptoms and their severity can vary greatly from person to person. With appropriate therapy and support, individuals can make significant strides in improving their quality of life, communication skills, and ability to function independently.
